# FIFA2k18-GO
* My first go web application here XD---> [WebApp](https://gofifa2k18.herokuapp.com/)
* All match data, updated every minute .
* Results for teams (wins, losses, draws, and points)
* Still in Beta phase , working on adding more features to it which the parent json-api provides .
* TO-DO 
```
  * To Return the current match, if a match is happening, otherwise nothing .
  * Matches for any country, by entering their FIFA Code.
  * Some optional parameters to the endpoint api's
  * Frontend-work (html template is very basic for now)
```
